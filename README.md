# Made With Love In
A label for developers to add to their sites, so they can promote themselves and their country. 

## Why should I add the MWLI label to my site?
When someone visits a site that uses the MWLI label he immediately reacts with a smile. Either if it's a product or a movement, the user feels happy and immediately supports the project! By clicking the label he is transfered to this site and has the ability to search for more projects that are part of our big community, thus spreading the word about them.

## What about language support?
Don't worry we've got your back. We are currently trying to translate our label in all the languages.
You can support us by translating the label in your language!
